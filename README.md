# 👋 Hey, I’m Luca

I’m a self-taught developer from Argentina.

I enjoy building things, learning as I go, and keeping solutions simple and readable. Most of what I learn comes from shipping, breaking stuff, and fixing it again. I care about clean code, but I care more about things working in the real world.

Open to projects, ideas, or just saying hi.
