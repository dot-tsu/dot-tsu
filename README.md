# 👋 Hey, I’m Luca

I’m a self-taught developer from Argentina.

I like building things and figuring stuff out as I go. Most of what I've learned comes from actually shipping projects, breaking them, and fixing them. I try to keep my code simple and readable, and I care more about things working than being clever.

Always open to building something interesting or exchanging ideas.

Open to projects, ideas, or just saying hi.
